Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.\n\nSerology testing (looking for antibody) utilizing indirect immunofluorescences or EIA is the most commonly used methodology. IFA is considered the reference method due to its high specificity and sensitivity in both acute and chronic infections.

				"questionText": "An electrophoresis separation of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme that demonstrates elevation in LD-1 greater than LD-2 could be indicative of:",
				"explanationText": "Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH or LD) is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells (animals, plants, and prokaryotes). LD catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and back, as it converts NAD+ to NADH and back.\n\nA dehydrogenase is an enzyme that transfers a hydride from one molecule to another. LDH is expressed extensively in body tissues, such as blood cells and heart muscle. Because it is released during tissue damage, it is a marker of common injuries and disease such as heart failure.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase is composed of four subunits (tetramer). The two most common subunits are the LD-M and LD-H protein, encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, respectively. These two subunits can form five possible tetramers (isoenzymes).\n\nThese five isoforms are enzymatically similar but show different tissue distribution:\nLD-1 (4H)—in the heart and in RBC (red blood cells), as well as the brain\nLD-2 (3H1M)—in the reticuloendothelial system\nLD-3 (2H2M)—in the lungs\nLD-4 (1H3M)—in the kidneys, placenta, and pancreas\nLD-5 (4M)—in the liver and striated muscle\n\nLD-2 is usually the predominant form in the serum. An LD-1 level higher than the LD-2 level (an LD Flip) suggests myocardial infarction (damage to heart tissues releases heart LD, which is rich in LD-1, into the bloodstream). The use of this phenomenon to diagnose infarction has been largely superseded by the use of Troponin I or T measurement.\n\nIn normal condition, LD-2 level is higher than LD-1. The reverse is true in myocardial infarction and during states of hemolysis. \n\nPancreatitis does cause increased level of LD-1, but the LD-3 is the most affected in this condition.\n\nHepatic injury also increases the level of LD, but LD-4 is the most affected in this condition.",

The RPR and VDRL detect non-treponemal antibody proteins called REAGIN that the body produces in response to infection with T.pallidum. Because Reagin proteins are also detected in pregnancy, old age, Lupus and other syndromes and disease states, the RPR and VDRL tests are very sensitive, but not highly specific and so a confirmatory test specifically for treponemal organisms or antibodies needs to be performed.\n\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Syphilis can be spread by having sex, from mother to baby during pregnancy or birth, or coming into close skin to skin contact with someone who is infected with syphilis.\n\nTests used to screen for syphilis include:\n- Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test. The VDRL test checks blood or spinal fluid for an antibody that can be produced in people who have syphilis. This antibody is not produced as a reaction to syphilis specifically, so the test result could be abnormal for reasons other than syphilis.\n- Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. The RPR test also finds syphilis antibodies.\n\nWhenever a screening test (RPR, VDRL) is positive, a confirmation test (FTA-ABS, TP-MHA) should be performed to rule out a false positive.\n\nTests used to confirm a syphilis infection include:\n- Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test. This blood test checks for syphilis antibodies. A positive EIA test should be confirmed with either the VDRL or RPR tests.\n- Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.

Some of the more common patterns include:\n- HOMOGENOUS (diffuse): when the entire nucleus is stained with ANA. Most common and least concerning pattern of ANA.  Associated with SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, and drug-induced lupus.\n- SPECKLED: Fine and coarse speckles throughout the nucleus. Associated with SLE, Sjogren syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease\n- NUCLEOLAR: Stain is seen around the nucleolus inside the nucleus.

This is especially important for premature babies trying to expand their lungs after birth. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, lecithin and sphingomyelin being two of them. Lecithin makes the surfactant mixture more effective.\nThe outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amniotic fluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation, when the lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly the same. As such, if a sample of amniotic fluid has a higher ratio, it indicates that there is more surfactant in the lungs and the baby will have less difficulty breathing at birth. \nAn L/S ratio of 2.4 or more indicates fetal lung maturity and a relatively low risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome, and an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is associated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nAlpha fetoprotein is used in assessing the potential genetic disorder.\n\nBilirubin is used in diagnosing the cause of jaundice and other liver problem.\n\nfetal hemoglobin is not used to assess fetal lung maturity.",

Cortisol is a steroid hormone made by the adrenal glands (in zona fasciculata) that is important for regulating glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, suppressing the immune system's response, and helping to maintain blood pressure.\nACTH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland as part of the endocrine system.\nNormally, ACTH levels increase when cortisol is low and fall when cortisol is high. In response to a fall in the blood cortisol level, the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This stimulates the production of ACTH by the pituitary, which in turn stimulates the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, small organs located at the top of each kidney. To make the appropriate amounts of cortisol, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands must be functioning properly.\n\nConditions that affect the hypothalamus, pituitary, or adrenal glands interfere with ACTH regulation and cortisol production, increasing or decreasing how much of the hormones the glands produce. This can cause signs and symptoms associated with an excess or deficiency of cortisol. Conditions that affect ACTH include Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), and hypopituitarism.\n\n The dexamethasone suppression test  is used to help diagnose the cause of increase cortisol. The test shows an elevated cortisol (no suppression), indicating that the problem is therefore an overproduction of ACTH from an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor.\n\nCushings Disease is a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH, however, the dexamethasone test will shut off the ACTH production in this case. Therefore, dropping the cortisol level.\nAddison Disease is a decreased cortisol level and therefore low blood pressure, glucose level, and dizziness/fatigue.\nDiabetes may account for the elevated glucose, but the level of ACTH and cortisol",

				"questionText": "The tumor marker associated with ovarian cancer is:",
				"explanationText": "CA-125, a mucinlike glycoprotein, is expressed on the surface of the main body cavity, coelomic, epithelium and human ovarian carcinoma cells. CA 125 is relatively more sensitive in low-stage ovarian cancer. This classic tumor marker is elevated in cancer and benign disease of various organs, e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, but is most useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas.\n\nCA15-3/CA27.29 both of these tumor markers are associated with breast cancer. CA 15-3 is a marker used to monitor patient response to treatment and recurrence of cancer after mastectomy. A change in the CA 15-3 concentration is more predictive than the absolute concentration. This marker can be positive in other conditions, e.g. liver disease, some inflammatory condition, and other carcinomas. CA27.29 is called the breast Carcinoma-Associated Antigen. This marker is not recommended for breast cancer screening but the marker may be helpful in conjunction with other clinical methods for predicting early recurrence of breast cancer.\n\nProstate-Specific Antigen (PSA) has been a controversial marker because of its limitations as a screening tool. PSA is a prostate-tissue specific marker but not a prostate cancer-specific marker. It is a protease enzyme secreted almost exclusively by prostatic epithelial cells. Blood levels of PSA are increased when normal glandular structure is disrupted by benign or malignant tumor inflammation. False positive, elevated results have been generated in prostate infection, irritation, benign prostatic hypertrophy and recent ejaculation. The value of monitoring PSA over time is that an acceleration in the concentration of PSA is suggestive of an increasing tumor volume of prostatic cancer.\n\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker that is useful in differentiating between benign and malignant pleural and ascites effusions. CEA is found predominantly on normal fetal endocrine tissues in the second trimester of gestation.

Acid-fast organisms are highly resistant to disinfectants and dry conditions.\n\nBecause the cell wall is so resistant to most compounds, acid-fast organisms require a special staining technique.  The primary stain used in acid-fast staining, CARBOLFUSCHIN, is lipid-soluble and contains phenol, which helps the stain penetrate the cell wall.  This is further assisted by the addition of heat.  The smear is then rinsed with a very strong decolorizer, which strips the stain from all non-acid-fast cells but does not permeate the cell wall of acid-fast organisms. The decolorized non-acid-fast cells then take up the counterstain.\nThe most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the ZIEHL-NEELSEN stain, in which the acid-fast species are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background. Another method is the KINYOUN method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background. Acid-fast Mycobacteria can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example).

				"explanationText": "Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test is a non-treponemal assay. It is a flocculation test that measures IgM and IgG antibodies to lipoidal material released from damaged host cells, to lipoprotein-like material, and possibly to cardiolipin released from the treponemes. Anti-lipoidal antibodies are antibodies that are not only produced as a consequence of syphilis and other treponemal diseases, but also may be produced in response to non-treponemal diseases of an acute or chronic nature in which tissue damage occurs.\n\nChemiluminescent immunoassays are treponemal assay that detect specific IgG and/or IgM directed against T. pallidum. These assays are popular because they can be performed at a low cost with automated equipment.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays is an attractive treponemal assay because it can discriminate between maternally derived IgG antibodies that cross the placenta from IgM antibodies that cannot cross the placental barrier. The presence of IgG indicates active infection in the newborn.\n\nFluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) can be used to confirm that a positive non-treponemal test result has been caused by syphilis rather than by other biological conditions that can produce a positive serologic result.",

A transferrin saturation result of >45% is diagnostic for HH.\n\nIn HH, iron accumulations will be seen in the liver and other organs. Liver biopsies are invasive procedures, which can be used to help confirm HH, but are not needed to screen for HH.\nTherapeutic phlebotomy is typically the treatment for HH. Each unit of blood can remove 250 mg of iron.\nSerum iron levels are elevated in HH, however, serum iron levels alone is not a sufficient screening test for HH.\n\nHereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. Because humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, excess iron can overload and eventually damage tissues and organs. For this reason, hereditary hemochromatosis is also called an iron overload disorder. Early detection may permit treatment before the development of substantial iron overload.",
